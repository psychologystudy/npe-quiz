" A particular psychologist starts all their first contacts with new clients the same way. Before gaining information from the client, they note the purpose, duration, cost, and the nature of their first psychological contact.

One impact of psychologists structuring first contact with clients in this way is that it: ", Reduces premature termination , Makes clients reticent to talk openly as they are now concerned about the limits to confidentiality , Increases the likelihood that the client will not return to therapy as a therapeutic relationship was not established at the start with a psychologist showing interest in them as a person before structuring their time together , Increases client anxiety , Reduces client resistance to change , A ," A is the most appropriate response. The main benefit to structuring first therapeutic contact is to manage client expectations and thus reduce premature termination where a client leaves services before a positive result is realised. B is not the most appropriate response. Clients require information regarding confidentiality and its limits and service costs to help make an informed decision about what to share and how to engage in psychological services.

" Simone had her first panic attack 1 year ago. She was at a dress rehearsal and about to perform on stage when, suddenly, she felt an intense wave of fear. The stage started spinning and she felt like she was going to throw up. Her whole body began shaking, she found it difficult to breathe, and her heart was thumping out of her chest. She sat down on the stage until the episode passed, but it left her feeling numb and deeply shaken. Simone has been unable to perform on stage since this first episode. Simone had another panic attack 1 month later, and since then, they’ve been occurring regularly, almost monthly. She’s afraid to go out in public because she doesn’t know when she’ll next suffer a panic attack. She refuses to perform again, and her friends and family are concerned for her well-being. The psychologist has diagnosed Simone with panic disorder. Which of the following statements does not support this diagnosis? "," Simone experiences frequently, unexpected panic attacks. ", Simone has had at least one attack followed by at least 1 month of worry about additional panic attacks. , Simone does not go out in public to avoid a future panic attack. , Simone is unsure why she experienced stage fright and began taking medication to help control the intense fear she experiences when on stage. , None of the above , D , A supports the diagnosis of panic disorder.

" Andrew is a gifted child. From an early age of 3 years, he was able to reason abstractly, think metaphorically, and he showed insight on social and moral issues. He is now about to enter high school, and his parents want to strengthen his cognitive talents through a specific gifted and talented program. The psychologist decides to administer the SB5 to inform intervention options. Which of the following is not one of the main benefits of administering the SB5 over other intelligence tests? "," The FSIQ obtained from the SB5 measures the general ability to reason, solve problems, and adapt to the environment. It reflects five major facets of intelligence, including reasoning, stored information, memory, visualisation, and the ability to solve novel problems. ", The SB5 is appealing and engaging to gifted children. , Clinicians who administer the SB5 can make their own judgements when scoring and interpreting the results of a gifted child. , The SB5 has continued the Binet tradition of being largely untimed. ," The SB5 provides a quick and easy measure of intelligence, especially if the ABIQ is administered to the gifted child, taking less than 20 minutes to complete. ", E ," A is correct. Factor analysis of the SB5 suggests that it does measure the five factors it was designed to measure, including those predictive of school achievement and those generally recognised by experts in giftedness as key elements of higher-order thinking and general reasoning. B is correct. There are many gifted children who present challenges in testing and examiners need to remain flexible and responsive to varying situations. Gifted children usually remain focused and catch on easily to instructions. They tend to give creative, often divergent answers that show their ability to make connections between ideas. Gifted children especially enjoy the interactive and kinaesthetic nature of the nonverbal tasks on the SB5. C is correct. The SB5 allows for flexibility in considering alternate ways to score the test when young children perform at a level far above age expectations. D is correct. Only a few timed items remain in the SB5. Gifted children can become energised by the unusual intellectual challenge and the SB5 accommodates the creative element by not imposing strict time limits on the tasks. E is incorrect. Thus, this is the correct answer to this question as you were asked to identify which is not one of the main benefits. Most intelligence tests take about 1 hour to administer, on average. The ABIQ wouldn’t be administered to a gifted child because the clinician needs to remain flexible for new situations and select those tasks that best measure the abilities of the specific gifted child on the day. The results of the FSIQ can then inform an intervention program that best supports the gifted child’s cognitive, social, and emotional needs. ", Assessment

C is the most appropriate response. When interpreting assessment scores, examiners are able to make informed hypotheses regarding the examinee’s performance. While this statement may not be true of Tenzin, it is an appropriate hypothesis to make and should be considered in the context of all other relevant information. Recommendations for increased educational services at school may also be ideal if Tenzin warrants a diagnosis of Dyslexia.
