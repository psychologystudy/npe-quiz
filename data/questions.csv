This is a common NPE pitfall on interpretation questions.",Assessment
Which WAIS-IV indexes compose the General Ability Index (GAI)?,VCI and PRI,VCI and WMI,PRI and PSI,WMI and PSI,,A,"GAI uses only Verbal Comprehension (VCI) and Perceptual Reasoning (PRI), excluding working memory and processing speed. NPE often tests index composition and what GAI represents.",Assessment
